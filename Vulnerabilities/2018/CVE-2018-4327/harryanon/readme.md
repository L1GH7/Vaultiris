POC for CVE-2018-4327 (atleast I think so since CVE-2018-4327 and CVE-2018-4330 were both written about by @SparkZheng but it does not say which once relates to which bug but since he described this one first then I'm taking a guess).

Tested on iPhone 6S 11.3.1  
Should work until 11.4

Let's you set the PC (ARM's version for IP register) to a value of your choice on SpringBoard and a few services.
You need to run the code and then go to the BT menu on settings and connect to a device. If it doesn't work turn the BT off and on.  
Pretty annoying to exploit but I liked it so I wanted to make a POC and learn on the way.

Used @raniXCH bluetoothdPoC code to handle all the preperation of the Mach message and sending of it to the BT service and adapted it to fit this POC.  
Used jtool to find the ordinal and other stuff.  
Had to do a bit RE to find the correct message sizes.
