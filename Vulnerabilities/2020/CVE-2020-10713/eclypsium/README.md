# BootHole
## General information
This repository was created to contain relevant helpful scripts and any additional tools or information that
can assist others in managing their BootHole vulnerability mitigation plans.

## Windows Based Platforms
We have created a Powershell script that will check the EFI System Partition for signed executable files that were revoked by Microsoft in the BootHole DBX Update

## Linux Based Platforms
Similarly to the Windows Powershell script above,  we have also created a Linux Bash script that will check for any signed executable files revoked in the BootHole DBX update .


# If you encounter any issues please report them and we will try our best to assist you as soon as we can.
