        This is PoC for using <b>GateKeeperResponse</b> for making bundle
        that changes its contents after sending it through binder

        \n\nFirst button is basic test that runs both attacker code and victim code in this process

        \n\nSecond button uses that bundle to bypass check in AccountManagerService that validates
        that provided Intent opens app having same signature as caller has and then forwards Bundle
        to other app (which unexpectedly gets another Intent after transfer, in this case pointing
        to PlatLogoActivity)

        \n\nThird button will do same trick as second, however it will start InstallAppProgress
        Activity in Package Installer, causing installation of APK without prompting user
        for permission (This PoC has packaged old version of AOSP ApiDemos, which will be installed,
        uninstall ApiDemos app first if after clicking Install APK message about corrupt package
        shows up)
