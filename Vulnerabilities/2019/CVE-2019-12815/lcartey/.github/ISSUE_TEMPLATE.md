### What I Did

Please describe what you did, including the clients you used, what errors
or messages you saw, _etc_.

### What I Expected/Wanted

Please describe what behavior you wanted to achieve, what you expected to see.
Sometimes the "bug" is simply that ProFTPD is doing something different than
what you expected, and sometimes the desired behavior can be done using
different approaches.  And sometimes, knowing what you expected to see helps
us to better pinpoint the root cause of the problem/issue.

### ProFTPD Version and Configuration

Please help us reproduce the problem/issue you are encountering.  To do this,
we need to know which version of ProFTPD you are using, how it was built,
_etc_.  The following command is an easy way to get all of this information:

    $ proftpd -V

In addition, we need to see *all* of the ProFTPD configuration files you are
using (*minus* any sensitive information like passwords, of course).  Armed
with the version and configuration data, then, we can set up ProFTPD locally
using the same configuration, and see what happens.
