## How to use

1. Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Compile the project using `npm run build`.
3. Run `node ./dist/index.js` to create the evil certificate in `./dist/cve-2019-5010-cert.pem`.
4. Bring up the victim container with `docker-compose up`.

This is honestly probably the most unimpressive exploit ever. The docker
container will crash with exit code 139 if you are successful and 0 if
the exploit does not work.
