# Issue feedback guidelines 

  Feedback channel is [here](https://github.com/Gobysec/Goby/issues). When giving feedback, you need to indicate your `current system type` and `Goby version`. 
  You can also try to use the following resources to solve your problem:

- Find the solution in the FAQ table: <a href="https://gobies.org/faq.html" target="_blank">https://gobies.org/faq.html</a>
- Watch the video tutorial: <a href="https://gobies.org/features.html" target="_blank">https://gobies.org/features.html</a>
- Find solutions or ask questions on Github issues:<a href="https://github.com/Gobysec/Goby/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/Gobysec/Goby/issues</a>

1. Please try to search for your problem, as it may have been resolved. If you find that an old and closed issue is still in the latest version, you should initiate a new issue instead of commenting on the old issue. 
2. If there is a version update, please try to update to the latest version first to see if it can solve the problem.
